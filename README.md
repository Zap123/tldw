# TL;DW - Too Long; Didn't Watch

TLDW is a tool that uses the OpenAI library to generate summaries of YouTube videos. It provides a quick and efficient way to get the main points of a video without having to watch the entire thing. With TLDW, you can save time and get the information you need.

## Usage

To generate a summary of a YouTube video, simply pass the video ID as an argument to the tldw command. The output will be a concise summary of the video's main points, generated by the OpenAI library.

tldw.py <youtube video id>

## Example

tl;dw In this video, the speaker discusses how to learn more efficiently and avoid burnout. They suggest five steps for successful learning: changing the environment, focusing on different tasks, getting enough sleep, task switching, and maintaining motivation and discipline. They recommend traveling if possible and doing exercise as a way to change focus, sleeping earlier and waking up without an alarm, clustering tasks into bigger time buckets and having a routine with sleep, and setting a schedule and relying both on motivation and discipline.


## Limits 
This is just an experiment, it doesn't work with videos that have very long subtitles. Further investigation will be required to overcome token limitations
